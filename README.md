This repository contains an Nginx configuration file `security.conf` designed to enhance the security of your web server by blocking various types of attacks, including SQL Injection (SQLi), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), and more.

## Steps to Implement

### 1. Create the `security.conf` File

To begin, create a new file named `security.conf` in the Nginx configuration directory:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/security.conf
```

### 2. Add the Configuration

Copy and paste the following configuration into security.conf. This file includes rules to block several types of malicious requests:

SQL Injection (SQLi)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Remote Code Execution (RCE)
XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks
Insecure HTTP Methods
Deserialization Attacks

### 3. Include security.conf in Nginx
To activate the configuration, add the following line to your nginx.conf or in a specific site configuration file located in /etc/nginx/sites-available/:

nginx
Copy code
include /etc/nginx/security.conf;
